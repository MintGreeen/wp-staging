<h3> Why should you use a staging website? </h3>

Every plugin update and theme customization should be tested on a staging platform first! 
This is necessary to prevent your website from serious issues if a new plugin contains errors or isn´t compatible to your wordpress version or server adjustment.
Unfortunately, testing a plugin update before installing in live environment isn´t done very often by most user because existing staging solutions are too complex and need a lot of time for creation of a 
up-to-date copy of your website.

Some people are also afraid of installing plugins updates because they follow the rule "never touch a running system" with having in mind that untested updates are increasing the risk of breaking their site.
We totally understand this, but unfortunately this leads to one of the main reasons why WordPress installations are often outdated, not updated at all and unsecure due to this non-update behavior.

<strong> We want to change this, so we created "Staging" </strong>

Let´s make WordPress a better and more secure place!
